          <h4>The Mystery of Human Life</h4><br>
          <p>Have you ever wondered why you are living in this world
            and what the purpose of your life is? There are six keys
            that unlock this mystery.<br><br>
            <strong>1. God’s Plan.</strong>
            God desires to express Himself through man (Rom. 8:29).
            For this purpose,He created man in His own image (Gen.
            1:26). Just as a glove is made in the image of a hand to
            contain a hand, so also man is made in the
            image of God to contain God. By receiving
            God as his content, man can express God (2 Cor. 4:7).<br><br>
            <strong>2. Man.</strong>
            To fulfill His plan, God made man as a
            vessel (Rom. 9:21-24). This vessel has three
            parts: body, soul, and spirit (1 Thes. 5:23). The body contacts
            and receives the things of the physical realm. The
            soul, the mental faculty, contacts and receives the things
            of the psychological realm. And the human spirit, the
            innermost part of man, was made to contact and receive
            God Himself (John 4:24).Man was created not merely to
            contain food in his stomach, or to contain knowledge in
            his mind, but to contain God in his spirit (Eph. 5:18).<br><br>
          </p>

          <p><br>
            <strong>3. Man’s Fall.</strong>
            But before man could receive God as life into his spirit,
            sin entered into him (Rom. 5:12). Sin deadened his spirit
            (Eph. 2:1), made him an enemy of God in his mind (Col.
            1:21), and transmuted his body into sinful flesh (Gen. 6:3;
            Rom. 6:12). Thus, sin damaged all three parts of man,
            alienating him from God. In this condition, man could
            not receive God.<br><br>
            <strong>4. Christ’s Redemption for God’s Dispensing.</strong>
            Nevertheless, man’s fall did not deter God from fulfilling
            His original plan. In order to accomplish His plan, God
            first became a man called Jesus Christ (John 1:1, 14).
            Then Christ died on the cross to redeem man (Eph. 1:7),
            thus taking away his sin and bringing him back to God
            (John 1:29; Eph. 2:13). Finally, in resurrection, He
            became the life-giving Spirit so that He could dispense
            His unsearchably rich life into man’s spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b;
            John 20:22; 3:6).<br><br>
            <strong>5. Man’s Regeneration.</strong>
            Since Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, man can
            now receive God’s life into his spirit. The Bible calls this
            regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:3). To receive this life,
            man needs to repent to God and believe in the Lord Jesus
            Christ (Acts 20:21; 16:31).<br><br>
            To be regenerated, simply come to the Lord with an open
            and honest heart and say to Him:<br><br>
            <center><em>
              Lord Jesus, I am a sinner.<br>
              I need You.<br>
              Thank You for dying for me.<br>
              Lord Jesus, forgive me.<br>
              Cleanse me from all my sins.<br>
              I believe You rose from the dead.<br>
              I receive You right now as my Savior and life.<br>
              Come into me! Fill me with Your life!<br>
              Lord Jesus, I give myself to You for Your purpose.
            </center></em><br>

          <img class="feed-image" src="img/corona-virus.jpg"alt="COVID-19">
          <h4>Life During COVID-19 Pandemic</h4><br>
          <p>I can't imagine before it is going to happen like this. We are very
            busy doing our day-to-day normal life. But behind the scene the enemy
            is already attacking, and the world did not know that it will  later
            become a danger to everyone's life. This virus is very dangerous,
            when we are hit we become vulnerable, and after few months have passed,
            WHO declared that COVID-19 is a threat for global pandemic.
            <br><br>
            I was in Metro Manila that time seeking for a job and I am already hearing the news
            about the epidemic that is happening in Wuhan, China started last December
            2019. I am expecting that in just a few weeks or months they will resolve
            the problem and contain the virus. But then suddenly, the virus spread
            in every part of the world.
            <br><br>
            Luckily a week before the Philippine president declared lockdown in NCR,
            I already went home to our town at the province because I will be taking
            an examination, but later announced that it was postponed because of COVID-19.
            Yes that was unfortunate, because it is the only reason why I go home,
            I left my new job there in Makati and no examination happened here in
            the province. But I'm still very blessed, because God arranged this things
            to happen. There are so many people stranded there in Metro Manila, suffering
            a lot of things, specially their daily necessities such as food. I am
            thinking, If I were left there during those hard times, my life will not
            be that so easy.
            <br><br>
            Ofcourse life today is very different than before, we need to observe and
            practice social distancing,proper hygiene, daily exercise and nutritious
            food intake, wearing of mask and applying of alcohol or disinfectants is a must.
            And we should do all this things to avoid getting infected even if the pandemic ends.
            <br><br>
            And instead of lying down at my bed over thinking the outward situations
            and imprisoning myself at my room, I try to be productive. One time, my eldest sister
            and my mother is trying to make a washable face mask and I tried to join them
            to conceptualize the idea and design how it will be made. This is very timely
            because people are in great need of facemasks and PPEs. Before I have no
            idea on how to do tailoring and now I have learned already and made my own facemasks.
            I also spend my time on the internet but ofcouse with productivity and multitasking.
            This is by doing my website (this website) and at the same time earning some little
            amount of points from an app and can be converted into an airtime load. There are
            also some old laptops and gadgets that are broken here and I tried to fix some of them.
            I also spared some of their parts that are compatible for hardware upgrade. This are some
            of the few things I do and many more during the pandemic.
            <br><br>
            Never forget to pray and pursue the Lord together at home. My family is doing this
            always and I hope also yours. The Lord is very faithful to us
            because we are still alive, breathing and enjoying our life every moment. But this
            life is just temporary, if we are infected and badly hit by that virus, we can be dead.
            We are being reminded again, that without God we are nothing, but when we have Him,
            we have everything. This is the best time for us to draw nearer to Him, talk to Him,
            pray to Him, recieve Him. May all our hearts be rekindled and come back to Him.
            Godbless all and keep safe!

          <h4>Applying for a Job</h4><br>
          <p>Finally, I have found my new job! But before talking too much about that,
            I want to share my difficult experiences before and during my job applications.
            <br><br>
            Right after my graduation in college, I consecrated myself to join the best place and environment
            for me to gain the most precious One in the universe. This is not money,
            not educational attainment, not material possesions, or meaningful relationships,
            this is no other than God Himself. This place I am referring where I spent a year
            to be trained in the aspect of "Life, Truth, Character, Service & Gospel" is the
            <a href="https://fttmalabon.org/">Full-time Training in Malabon.</a> It is not our topic
            but is worth emphasizing and I encourage specially young people who are fresh graduates to join this training.
            Having education only is not enough for us to face the outside world.
            We must also have God first and a proper character so that we can be more useful
            not only for world but also for the Lord. That is why before
            spending my whole life in gaining these temporary worldy riches, I wanted to first gain
            the Lord and mold my character with the help of this training. And everything that the world has to offer,
            all of these things I will let God be the center, even my entire being. That's how
            important this training to me after gaining my college degree.
            <br><br>
            After that, I hope to spend sometime to rest and have vacation at home for a bit of time.
            Then, I went home, and actually I am already applying for a job online those times,
            and I have recieved few interview invitations, and phone calls. I wanted to go to Manila
            again to find a job and submit my application but there is a need for me to stay home for
            a few months to watch closely my niece because there is no one available at home and
            my mom is still in Thailand. With that situation, I tried to apply in the province, but
            unfortunately job opportunities here for my profession is very limited, most often graduates
            here just take job mismatch  in order for them to have a job. Then I tried to do
            partime as what I am doing during my college years.
            <br><br>
            Someone invited me to apply to their company because they appreciated the graphic works I am
            submitting to them. Instead of doing part-time for them they wanted me to work for full-time to their newly opened
            hotspot destination for tourist as a multimedia personnel. But due to some issue that are arising
            in that area, my application there did not push through. So then, I tried and tried again to look for a
            job that really fits for me. Until the day that mom already arrived home from Thailand, and yes
            this is my most awaited moment, I can now go back to Metro Manila to find the job I am looking for.
            <br><br>
            I was then in Metro Manila, the very center of the IT industry here in the Philippines,
            and I was temporarily based in Quezon City in my cousin's house. I seize every
            opportunities there, but it was not that easy. I applied to more than 20 IT companies,
            including BPO, some are still pending, some I have taken exams,
            and some even I reached until final interview. I am waiting for the first one who will accept me
            and who believe on my set of skills and abilities. Until the money that I have is nearly being
            consumed. But I did not lose hope, I know that God will give that job for me. And there it is,
            finally I was accepted as a "Customer Engineer at TIM Engineering System Solution Corp." based
            in Makati City last March 4, 2020 and signed the job offer via online on March 13, 2020 amid of
            COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, I was supposed to start working last March 30, 2020 but it was postponed
            due to lockdown which resulted to some companies and businesses to temporary hold their operations.
            I always pray, and I know everyone is hoping that the pandemic will end soon and everything will be back to normal.
